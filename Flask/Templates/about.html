            <h2> Intelligent Garbage Classification Using Deep Learning</h2>
            <p> Intelligent garbage classification is a modern approach to waste management that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to sort and separate different types of waste. It involves the use of advanced sensors, image recognition technology, and machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and sort various waste materials, including plastics, paper, glass, and metals.At its core, intelligent garbage classification aims to improve the efficiency of waste management systems while reducing the environmental impact of waste disposal. By separating recyclable materials from non-recyclable ones, it helps to increase the amount of waste that can be recycled and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or incinerators.At our website, we are committed to promoting the use of intelligent garbage classification and educating the public about its benefits. Through our articles and resources, we aim to raise awareness about the importance of proper waste management and encourage the adoption of innovative solutions that can help create a cleaner, more sustainable future.</p>
            <p> According to the next 25 years, the less developed countries’ waste accumulation will increase drastically. With the increase in the number of industries in the urban area,the disposal of the solid waste is really becoming a big problem, and the solid waste includes paper, wood, plastic, metal, glass etc. The common way of managing waste is burning waste and this method can cause air pollution and some hazardous materials from the waste spread into the air which can cause cancer. Hence it is necessary to recycle the waste to protect the environment and human beings’ health, and we need to separate the waste into different components which can be recycled using different ways.</p>
            <p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that allows computers to automatically
                interpret representations of data by learning from examples. The method used in for waste
                classification which uses ML, combines features such as color and texture for the recognition of waste
                images. Now, deep learning is developing rapidly in the field of image recognition. It uses a multi-layer
                network to process data to achieve feature extraction. Have been built a recyclable waste image dataset,
                including nearly 20,000 waste images, which are divided into five categories: glass, fabric, paper,
                plastic, and metal. Through this dataset, a Dense Net deep learning model based on transfer learning is
                trained. Based on the classic pre-trained CNN classification model, DenseNet169, combined with the
                idea of transfer learning, the accurate recognition and classification of recyclable waste is realized.</p>
            <p>The present way of separating waste/garbage is the hand-picking method, whereby someone is employed to separate out the different objects/materials. The person who separates waste, is prone to diseases due to the harmful substances in the garbage. With this in mind, it motivated us to develop an automated system which is able to sort the waste. and this system can take a short time to sort the waste, and it will be more accurate in sorting than the manual way. With the system in place, the beneficial separated waste can still be recycled and converted to energy and fuel for the growth of the economy. The system that is developed for the separation of the accumulated waste is based on the combination of Convolutional Neural Network.            </p>
