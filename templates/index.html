            <h2> Intelligent Garbage Classification Using Deep Learning</h2>
            <p> Welcome to our website dedicated to intelligent garbage classification!</p> 

            <p>Waste management is essential in todayâ€™s society. Due to an increase in population, the generation of waste is getting doubled day by day. Moreover, the increase in waste is affecting the lives of many people.For instance, people living in slums are very close to the waste disposal area. Therefore there are prone to various diseases. Hence, putting their lives in danger. In order to maintain a healthy life, proper hygiene and sanitation are necessary. Consequently, it is only possible with proper waste management.</p>

                and our technology makes it easier than ever to sort your trash efficiently. 
                Our intelligent garbage classification system uses advanced algorithms and
